Person-Hours Spent

From Project 1 and Project 2, we have 1516* and 1230* lines of code respectively. The person-hours per lines of code are 1/108 [person-hour/loc] and 1/82 [person-hour/loc] respectively for each aformentioned project. The average is 1/94 [person-hour/loc].

With the estimated lines of code for project 3 to be lower at around 400-500 lines of code, we estimate that it would take around 4-5 person-hours to code and implement the basic verison of Gomoku without AI, or extra features.
The estimation using lines of code does not include time doing documentation.
